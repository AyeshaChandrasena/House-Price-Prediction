# House-Price-Prediction
his project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more.

Using a dataset of housing information, the notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training regression models to estimate housing prices accurately.

Key features of this project include:

    Data cleaning and handling of missing values

    Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations

    Feature selection and encoding

    Training and evaluating multiple regression models

    Model performance comparison and optimization

This project is useful for demonstrating fundamental skills in data science and machine learning, including real-world data handling and predictive modeling.
